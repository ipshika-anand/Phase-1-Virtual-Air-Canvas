## Mini Project: Phase 1

## VIRTUAL AIR CANVAS: Hand Gesture Controlled Digital Blackboard

## Project Overview

_Ever wanted to draw your imagination by just waving your finger in the air?_

Embark on a journey into the dynamic realm of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with our groundbreaking project, Air Canvas. By harnessing the power of gesture recognition and real-time image processing, Air Canvas revolutionizes digital art creation and user interaction. 

Wave goodbye to traditional tools as users simply move their fingers in the air to unleash their creativity, free from the constraints of expensive pens or cumbersome devices.

Despite existing challenges in achieving optimal hand tracking accuracy, our project aims to bridge the gap by implementing innovative solutions and enhancing system performance. Air Canvas offers a seamless and intuitive user experience, empowering individuals to express themselves effortlessly in the digital realm.

Through projects like Air Canvas, we're not just redefining the boundaries of digital art creation; we're shaping a future where technology fosters inclusivity, creativity, and positive social impact.
